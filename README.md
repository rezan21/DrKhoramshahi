Designed with pure CSS. The layout is formed by CSS GRID where possible, to avoid floating elements problems. e.g:clearfix

"CSS Grid Layout is the most powerful layout system available in CSS. It is a 2-dimensional system, meaning it can handle both columns and rows, unlike flexbox which is largely a 1-dimensional system. — Chris House"https://www.chris.house
 
JavaScript and jQuery have been used to make the website more functional, interactive and user friendly. Google API's are used to display certain locations on the map.

website is deployed on a server and accessible  on https://drkhoramshahi.com or https://drkhoramshahi.com/english.html

SEO, Google Analytics and Digital marketing are in progress.
